            <p>&quot;If one had but a single glance to give the world, one should gaze on Istanbul.&quot; ~Alphonse de Lamartine</p>
             <h1>ISTANBUL</h1>
               <p>Istanbul, formerly known as Byzantium and Constantinople, is the most populous city in Turkey and the country's economic, cultural and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosporus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Marmara Sea and Black Sea.</p>
               <p>Over the centuries, many cultures have added their mark to this prized piece of land. Today, you can experience those influences firsthand by exploring Istanbul’s neighborhoods. From the holy sites of Sultanahmet and the grand examples of Ottoman Era architecture of Maiden’s Tower to Camlica Hill which is one of the seven hills of Istanbul, Eyup Sultan Mosque, one of the most holy and important mosques of Turkey, and a lovely neighborhood Ortakoy, right under the first Bosphorus bridge. It’s easy to see why travelers say that Istanbul isn’t just one city, but many cities within one.</p>

                <h2>Çamlıca Hill</h2>         
                    <p>Çamlıca Hill is located within the borders of Üsküdar district, on the Anatolian side of Istanbul, near the first suspension bridge. Çamlıca, a place with two hills overlooking the Bosphorus and the Marmara Sea, is one of the most favored promenades in Istanbul, and also one of the highest and most charming places in the city. It's divided into two sections as "Büyük Çamlıca" and "Kücük Çamlıca", meaning "Big" and "Small". Büyük Çamlıca is 267 meters above sea level and the other one is 228 meters.</p>
                    <p>Çamlıca got its name from the pine trees in the area (Çam means Pine in Turkish). First settlers turned the entire region into a pine forest, which survived not only the Roman period but also the Byzantines. According to the book of Turkish historian Ismail Hakki Konyali, in ancient times both Camlica hills were covered with pine trees so thick that no sunlight could shine through them. There were also wildflowers in all colors and poppies.</p>
                    <p>Today, With its traditional snack "Gozleme", ice cream and corn on the cob, with its kiosks, fountains, tea and coffee shops and restaurants operated by the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul, surrounded by historic trees, great flora, colorful flowers and tulips, and with a cool breeze, Camlica attracts many local and foreign visitors enjoying the magnificent panorama of the Bosphorus and the city.</p>
